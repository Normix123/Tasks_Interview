# Tasks Interview

## Task 1

Input
On the first line of the input you will be given number of test cases T (no greater than 100). T following lines will be numbers for evaluation (in range [-1000; 1000])
Output
Your program should produce T lines of output. Each line is the evaluation of the polynomial and should be same as the result of Cheetah's program. As was already said Cheetah's program evaluates polynomial of the form f(x) = A*x^4 + B*x^3 + C*x^2 + D*x + E. Print the values of f(x) with precision of 3 digits.

## Task 2

Input
The first line contains two integers N (4 ≤ N ≤ 10, N is even) and M (N ≤ M ≤ 20).
Then N lines follow, the i-th line contains one integer a [i] (0 <a [i] ≤ 3000). A new tire, installed on the i-th wheel, wears out completely after a [i] kilometers.
Output
Output the maximum number of kilometers that the vehicle can drive, rounded to three decimal places.

## Task 3

Various natural numbers A, B, N are given: 1 <A, B <10, 10 <N <100.
The sum of several numbers is equal to N, each of the numbers is equal to A or B.
Find the largest possible value for the product of these numbers. If such a situation is impossible, then output 0.

Input
Three integers in one line - A, B, N.
Output
Print an integer - the answer to the problem.

## Task 4

Input
The only line of the input file will contain two integers 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000.
Output
The program should output one single number - the minimum number of transfers.
